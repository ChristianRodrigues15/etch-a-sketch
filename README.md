# etch-a-sketch
This is an etch-a-sketch project made from scratch in order to practice DOM Manipulation with JavaScript
The goal is to create a functioning webpage which allows the user to create a canvas with an adjustable amount of rows/columns. The user can click on buttons to draw in specified colors or choose a button for random colors.
